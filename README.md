This is a Typst implementation of a combat reference sheet for [His Majesty the Worm]([https://hackmd.io/@Eldraen/SJd1_hBKL](https://www.hismajestytheworm.games/)) by Josh McCrowell.

I made this for my own use, as well as an exercise in learning [Typst](https://typst.app/), a modern markup language. Feel free to use, remix, and adapt this.
